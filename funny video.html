    <h2>Chaplin was named after his father, a British music-hall entertainer. He spent his early childhood with his
        mother, the singer Hannah Hall, after she and his father separated, and he made his own stage debut at age five,
        filling in for his mother. The mentally unstable Hall was later confined to an asylum.</h2>
